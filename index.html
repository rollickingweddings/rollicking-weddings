Our Manifesto
We’re here for the weirdos, the rebels, the glitter queens, the color junkies, and anyone daring enough to say “I do” their way. Let’s break traditions, sparkle louder, and celebrate love without limits. Because your wedding should be *yours*, full stop.
Inspiration
Rainbow Disco Wedding
Feathers, sequins, and roller skates — this couple took the theme to a whole new level.
Goth Garden Ceremony
Black lace, moon rituals, and an all-vinyl soundtrack — we’re obsessed.
DIY Punk Elopement
A courthouse kiss and a rooftop mosh pit — short, sweet, and seriously fierce.
